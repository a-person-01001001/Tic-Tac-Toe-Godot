# Tic Tac Toe

This is a Tic Tac Toe game that I made using Godot. This was my second
game that I ever made with Godot and GDScript.

# TODO

I have quite a few things to do before this is finished.

- [x] Get the board rendered in the correct position
- [x] Get letters to render
- [x] Render the letters in the correct place
- [x] Remove `Nil` exception when clicked outside of the grid
- [x] Switch turns every time the letter is placed
- [ ] Check the gamestate for if someone won
- [ ] Make the screen clear when someone wins
- [ ] Make everything reliant on `viewport.size`
- [ ] Make the screen look good
